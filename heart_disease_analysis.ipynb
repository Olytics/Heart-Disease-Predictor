    "We wish to create a simple machine learning classification model which can help us predict high risk individuals for heart disease. We try two methods: a logistic regression and an SVM with RBF kernel method to use 14 common features related to heart disease to make the predictions. We have attempted to return whether the patient is predicted to contract heart disease or not, and thus it can enable us to identify high-risk individuals and implement relevent prevention methods ahead of time. \n",

    "We select and F2 score as our model performance metric since we really care about having the least amount of False Negatives as possible. Our final classifier performed fairly well on an unseen test data set, with the F2 score, where beta = 2, of <> and an overall accuracy calculated to be <>. On the <num> test data cases, it correctly predicted <num>. It incorrectly predicted <num> cases, which were all false positives - predicting that a patient is prone to contract heart disease when they are in fact not. These kind of incorrect predictions is not as harmful as a false negative in our context. Although they could theoretically cause the patient to undergo unnecessary treatment if the model is used as a decision tool, we expect there to be additional decision layers which can mitigate this. As such, we believe this model is at the very least a useful tool for medical professionals to look at important cases more closely and have more frequent follow ups with important cases."

    "Ischemic heart disease or IHD is a condition in which narrowed coronary arteries reduce blood flow to the heart [[1]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (source: [https://data.who.int/countries/356], in India, a country of 1.4 billion people, consistently since 2010-2020 Heart Disease has been the leading cause of deaths (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death) over both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are now the **number one cause of mortality** in India, accounting for approximately **31%** of all deaths, according to the latest Sample Registration System report [[2]](https://www.business-standard.com/amp/health/cardiovascular-diseases-cause-one-third-of-all-deaths-in-india-report-125090500028_1.html). India’s age-standardized CVD death rate is estimated at **272 per 100,000**, significantly higher than the global average of about **235 per 100,000**. [[2]](Prabhakaran D, Jeemon P, Roy A. Cardiovascular Diseases in India: Current Epidemiology and Future Directions. Circulation. 2016 Apr 19;133(16):1605-20. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008729. PMID: 27142605.). According to one report, about **1.7 million deaths** in India (in 2019) were due to IHD, constituting **15.2%** of all deaths. Epidemiological data suggest a substantial prevalence: for example, there may be **~16.8 million Indians** living with IHD (as of 2019). ([Acibadem HealthPoint][4])\n",

    "If high-risk individuals can be identified before clinical events (like heart attacks), interventions (statin therapy, lifestyle modification, monitoring) can reduce morbidity and mortality. Traditional diagnosis often depends on physician expertise, subjective assessment, and resource-intensive tests. A data-driven predictive model (using clinical, demographic, and possibly imaging/lab data) could help flag patients more systematically, especially in resource-limited settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that CVDs cause almost one-third of all deaths in India, even modest improvements in early detection could produce large gains in population health.\n",
    "\n",
