    "We wish to create a simple machine learning classification model which can help us predict high risk individuals for heart disease. We try three methods: a logistic regression and an SVM with RBF kernel method to use 14 common features related to heart disease to make the predictions. We have attempted to return whether the patient is predicted to contract heart disease or not, and thus it can enable us to identify high-risk individuals and implement relevent prevention methods ahead of time. \n",

    "We select and F2 score as our model performance metric since we really care about having the least amount of False Negatives as possible. Our final classifier performed fairly well on an unseen test data set, with the F2 score, where beta = 2, of <> and an overall accuracy calculated to be <>. On the <num> test data cases, it correctly predicted <num>. It incorrectly predicted <num> cases, which were all false positives - predicting that a patient is prone to contract heart disease when they are in fact not. These kind of incorrect predictions is not as harmful as a false negative in our context. Although they could theoretically cause the patient to undergo unnecessary treatment if the model is used as a decision tool, we expect there to be additional decision layers which can mitigate this. As such, we believe this model is at the very least a useful tool for medical professionals to look at important cases more closely and have more frequent follow ups with important cases."

    "According to The American Heart Association (n.d.), Ischemic heart disease or IHD is a condition in which narrowed coronary arteries reduce blood flow to the heart. From the World Health Organization (n.d.), in India, a country of 1.4 billion people, consistently over the last decade (2010-2020), Heart Disease has been the leading cause of deaths over both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of mortality in India, accounting for approximately **31%** of all deaths, according to the latest Sample Registration System report (Press Trust of India, 2025). India’s age-standardized CVD death rate is estimated at **272 per 100,000**, significantly higher than the global average of about **235 per 100,000** (Gupta et al., 2018). According to one report, about **1.7 million deaths** in India (in 2019) were due to IHD, constituting **15.2%** of all deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "If high-risk individuals can be identified before clinical events (like heart attacks), interventions (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (n.d.)) can reduce morbidity and mortality. Traditional diagnosis often depends on physician expertise, subjective assessment, and resource-intensive tests. A data-driven predictive model could help select patients more prone to such cases, especially in resource-limited settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that CVDs cause almost one-third of all deaths in India, even minor improvements or supplementary methods in early detection could make a huge difference in population health. Thus, in this project we attempt to use measurable features to determine high risk cases which can lead to more careful monitoring and lead to early stage prevention measures."
